## Overview

Common Ground is a static website hosted on **GitHub Pages** and built with **Jekyll**, using the `jekyll-theme-cayman` theme with a custom layout. It has no server or database of its own:

- **Encyclopedia entries** are [EAC-CPF](https://eac.staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/) XML files in `civic/`. The browser fetches them and renders them on the fly.
- **Historical directory data** (Sands & McDougall directories and electoral rolls) is one JSON file per source and year in `_data/`. Jekyll publishes compact copies in `data/` plus an index, and each page loads only the files it needs through `scripts/data.js`.
- **Public contributions** go through a Google Apps Script web app. It saves a copy of each submission to a Google Sheet in the team's shared Google Drive folder, then opens a pull request on this repository. The sheet is a user-friendly backup while the submission process is being settled. The editorial team then merges the pull request (accept) or closes it (reject).

The project is deliberately a **perpetual work in progress**. Gaps in the data and entries that don't exist yet are invitations for the community to contribute, not defects.

Nothing is published until a pull request is merged into `main`. GitHub Pages rebuilds the site automatically after each merge, usually within a minute or two.

```

### Entry pages

`civic.md` uses `_layouts/entry.html`. A URL such as `civic?id=Corkman Hotel`:

1. turns the `id` into a filename slug (`Corkman-Hotel`);
2. fetches `civic/Corkman-Hotel.xml`;
3. parses the EAC-CPF XML (namespace `urn:isbn:1-931666-33-4`) and renders it;
4. adds the contribution form underneath. If no file exists yet, the form takes the entry's place so the community can create it. The form (`_layouts/form.html`, in an iframe) reports its height to the entry page, which sizes the iframe to fit.

With `preview=true`, `id` can be a full URL, such as a raw file on a pull-request branch. This is how `admin/review.html` previews submissions before they are merged. Preview mode also hides the banner, menu, footer and contribution form, so the review frame shows just the article.

### Search, facets and maps

- **Search page** (`search.md` → `_layouts/search.html` + `scripts/search.js`): one box that searches the entries in `civic/` and every directory and electoral-roll record together, using [MiniSearch](https://github.com/lucaong/minisearch) (vendored in `scripts/vendor/`, MIT). Jekyll lists the entry files into the page at build time and the browser fetches them as ordinary site files (no GitHub API calls). Entries are searchable at once; records join the index as each year's file arrives. Results are grouped into Entries, Places (directories) and People (electoral rolls); records that share a text `entityID` collapse into one result with a row of years. Matching is by prefix with small typos allowed, and a `VARIANTS` list at the top of `scripts/search.js` folds historical spellings and abbreviations together (Berkley/Berkeley, htl → hotel, Wm → William, …); add pairs there. The search is kept in the address (`search?q=grocer&year=1910&street=…&src=people`), so it can be shared. If nothing matches, it offers to start a new entry with that name.
- **People / Places** (`_layouts/facet-list.html`): load only the files for one `source`. `people` shows electoral rolls and `places` shows directories. Results are grouped by source/year → street → side of street, and each year is drawn as soon as its file arrives (oldest first). Within each year the streets are sorted, so each street appears once per year, and the contents list shows the year after each street (e.g. "Bouverie Street (1905) listings").
- **Map** (`_layouts/map.html`): Leaflet 1.9.4. It plots records that have `lat`/`lng`, with University of Melbourne land parcels (`data/uom-land-parcels.geojson`) as an overlay. Both maps load every year before drawing, because records without coordinates are placed between mapped ones on the same street.
- **3D Map** (`_layouts/map3d.html`): three.js r128 with OrbitControls. Experimental.
- Both maps share `scripts/map-common.js` (data loading, year colours, cross-year links from string `entityID`s, marker shapes) and the details popup in `_includes/map-details-modal.html`, which links to the matching entry.
- **Featured pages A–Z** (`aToZ.md` + `scripts/az-status.js`): Jekyll lists the files in `civic/` into the page at build time, and the script marks links with no entry yet (pencil icon, "Not yet written") and entries created in the last 14 days ("New"). A legend above the letter index explains both.

## Repository layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `_config.yml` | Jekyll config. Sets the theme and per-page defaults (layout, `EACCPFpath`, `facet`, whether the contribution form shows). |
| `_layouts/default.html` | Site shell: header, navigation, sidebar and footer. Does **not** load any data; layouts that need it load it through `scripts/data.js`. |
| `_layouts/search.html`, `scripts/search.js` | Search page (see [Search, facets and maps](#search-facets-and-maps)). |
| `_layouts/entry.html` | Fetches and renders one EAC-CPF entry, and adds the contribution form. |
| `_layouts/form.html` | Rich-text contribution form (Quill 1.3.6) that posts to Google Apps Script. |
| `_layouts/new.html` | "Start a new entry" box that redirects to `civic?id=…`. |
| `_layouts/facet-list.html` | People / Places listings. |
| `_layouts/map.html`, `_layouts/map3d.html` | 2D Leaflet map and 3D three.js map. |
| `scripts/map-common.js`, `_includes/map-details-modal.html` | Functions and the details popup shared by both maps. |
| `*.md` (root) | One small file per page. Mostly front matter that picks a layout. `aToZ.md` is the hand-maintained index of featured pages. |
| `civic/*.xml` | Published encyclopedia entries (EAC-CPF). |
| `_data/directory/<year>.json`, `_data/electoral-roll/<year>.json` | The directory and electoral-roll records, one file per source and year, one record per line. **Edit these.** See [Data](#data-directories-and-electoral-rolls). |
| `data/` | What the browser downloads, generated from `_data/` by Jekyll: one small page per data file, `data/index.json` (the list of files), and `uom-land-parcels.geojson` (University of Melbourne land parcels). |
| `scripts/data.js` | Shared data loader used by every page that shows records. |
| `tools/convert-map-data.js` | One-off script that split the old `map-data.js` into the files in `_data/`. |
| `admin/index.html` | Admin landing page for the editorial team, linking to each tool (served at `admin/`). The site footer links here. |
| `admin/review.html` | Plain-language review page for the editorial team. |
| `admin/carlton-data-editor.html` | Browser-based editor for the directory and electoral-roll files. |
| `scripts/az-status.js` | Marks Featured pages links as "New" or "Not yet written". |
| `scripts/banner-parallax.js` | Header banner effect. |
| `scripts/vendor/` | Third-party scripts saved into the repo (MiniSearch). |
| `styles/site.css` | Site styles. |
| `images/` | Static images. |

## Running the site locally

You need Ruby (3.x) and Bundler. The repo has no `Gemfile` yet, so create one locally (please don't commit it until we agree to; see the roadmap):

```ruby
# Gemfile
source "https://rubygems.org"
gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
gem "webrick"
```

Then:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
# open http://127.0.0.1:4000/
```

Notes:

- Internal links leave out `.html` (e.g. `civic?id=…`). GitHub Pages handles this, and `jekyll serve` normally does too. If a link 404s locally, try adding `.html`.
- `admin/review.html` reads from the live GitHub repo. `admin/carlton-data-editor.html` loads the data from the site it's served from, so locally it shows your local files.
- Submitting the contribution form locally **creates a real pull request** through the live Apps Script. Close any test pull requests afterwards.

## Content: encyclopedia entries (EAC-CPF XML)

Entries follow the EAC-CPF schema (`urn:isbn:1-931666-33-4`). For a full example, see `civic/Corkman-Hotel.xml` or `civic/Larrikins-and-Pushes.xml`.

**Current conventions.** These are still settling as the project goes. Please update this section when a decision is made.

- **Filename = slug of the entry ID**: spaces become `-`, anything other than letters, digits, `_` and `-` is removed, and the file goes in `civic/`, e.g. `Mary Mather (Pelham Hotel)` → `civic/Mary-Mather-Pelham-Hotel.xml`. The slug logic is `slugifyId()` in `_layouts/entry.html`. A file that doesn't match the slug won't be found.
- `<recordId>` and `<entityId>` match the filename (without `.xml`).
- `<maintenanceHistory>` records who contributed and when. The Apps Script sets this for public contributions.
- `<entityType>`: every entry so far uses `concept`, including people and hotels. *TBD: decide whether to use EAC-CPF's `person` / `corporateBody` / `family`.*
- To add an entry to the A–Z, add a link in `aToZ.md` by hand.

Open questions to settle: controlled vocabulary for `entityType` and `localType`, how to cite sources inside entries, how to handle images, how to link entries to directory records, and what to do with entries that have two names (e.g. *Carlton Inn* / *Corkman Hotel*).

## Data: directories and electoral rolls

The records come from public-domain sources: the **Sands & McDougall Directories of Victoria** and **Victorian electoral rolls**. There is one JSON file per source and year:

```
_data/directory/1900.json … 1930.json
_data/electoral-roll/1919.json, 1928.json
```

Each file is a JSON list with **one record per line**, so a change to a record shows up on GitHub as a one-line change. These are the files to edit.

**How the browser gets them.** Jekyll can read files in `_data/` but doesn't publish them, so on every build it generates:

- `data/directory/1905.json` etc.: compact copies for the browser. Each is a three-line page (`{{ site.data["directory"]["1905"] | jsonify }}`).
- `data/index.json`: the list of files, with each file's source, year, record count, range of numeric `entityID`s and every text `entityID` it uses. This lets a page find the files it needs, e.g. the contribution form fetches only the files that hold records for that entry.

Pages load the data through `scripts/data.js` (`CGData.load(...)`, `CGData.forEntity(id)`), which fetches each file at most once, shows "Loading the 1905 directory… (4 of 9)" while it works, and offers *Try again* if a file fails.

**Adding a new year:** add `_data/<source>/<year>.json`, then copy one of the small pages in `data/<source>/` to `data/<source>/<year>.json` and change the year in it. The index picks it up automatically.

| Source | Years | Records |
|---|---|---|
| Directory (Sands & McDougall) | 1900, 1905, 1910, 1915, 1920, 1925, 1930 | ~7,700 |
| Electoral roll | 1919, 1928 | ~1,500 |

Typical record:

```json
{
  "entityID": 2,
  "source": "Directory",
  "year": 1900,
  "pages": "172",
  "listing": "Intersection Barry street and Leicester street",
  "street": "Barry Street",
  "type": "Intersection",
  "cardinality": "East",
  "lat": -37.8037,
  "lng": 144.9604
}
```

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `entityID` | Usually a number: directories count up from 1, electoral rolls from 999999, so the two never share a number (the rolls were renumbered from 7034–8558 when the data was split, because they overlapped the 1930 directory). A **string** (e.g. `"Bridget O'Neill"`) means someone on the team has decided that several records are the same person or place, and linked them under a new ID they created for that purpose. Many records share a string ID on purpose; the search page shows each linked group as one result with a row of years, and links it to the entry of the same name if there is one (e.g. the Carlton Inn listings are linked under `"Corkman Hotel"`). |
| `source` | `"Directory"` or `"Electoral roll"`. This decides whether a record appears under People or Places. |
| `year`, `pages`, `listing`, `street`, `type`, `cardinality` | As transcribed. `cardinality` is the side of the street (North/South/East/West). |
| `lat`, `lng` | Optional. About 1,450 records have coordinates so far, and only these appear on the map. Adding more is ongoing community work. |
| `Surname`, `Given Names`, `Registration Number`, `Address`, `Street Number`, `Gender`, `Occupation`, `Notes` | Electoral-roll fields (Title Case, some with spaces). Some later directory records also have `Occupation` / `Notes`. |

### Editing the data

Use `admin/carlton-data-editor.html`. It loads the live data, lets you search and edit records, and then *Download changed files* gives one download per changed year (e.g. `1905.json`). Someone then has to upload each file to its folder on GitHub by hand (the editor links to the upload page and explains how). Check the downloaded filename is exactly the year (browsers sometimes save `1905 (1).json`), and reload the editor before you start so you don't overwrite someone else's changes. Small fixes can also be made directly on GitHub by editing the line for that record.

## Editorial workflows

### Reviewing a public submission (editorial team)

1. Open **`admin/review.html`** (or the [Admin page](https://notamitchell.github.io/order/admin/), then *Review submissions*). It lists open pull requests that add or change files in `civic/`.
2. Pick a submission to see a live preview of the entry as it would appear on the site.
3. Sign in to GitHub, then follow the link to the pull request:
   - **Accept:** *Merge pull request* → *Confirm merge*.
   - **Reject:** *Close pull request*. Ideally leave a short comment saying why.
   - **Needs changes:** edit the XML file on the pull request branch on GitHub, then merge.
4. The site updates a minute or two after merging.

The review page walks reviewers through these steps in plain language. If you change the workflow, update both that page and this section.

### Updating directory/map data

See [Editing the data](#editing-the-data) above. This is separate from entry submissions and needs more care, because a broken data file breaks search, the maps and the People/Places pages.

## Adding a new page or facet

- **Simple page:** add `my-page.md` at the root with front matter (`title`, optionally `layout`). It gets `layout: default` automatically.
- **New facet list** (like People/Places): add `my-facet.md`, add a `scope` block in `_config.yml` with `layout: facet-list` and `facet: "my-facet"`, and add a matching branch to the `filter` in `_layouts/facet-list.html`.
- **New entry collection** (another folder like `civic/`): add a page using `layout: entry` and set `EACCPFpath` to the folder name in `_config.yml`.
- **Navigation:** edit the `<nav>` list in `_layouts/default.html`. Footer links are in the same file.

## External services and dependencies

| Service / library | Used by | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub Pages | Hosting | Builds from `main`. |
| Google Apps Script web app | `_layouts/form.html` (`SCRIPT_URL`) | Saves a copy of each submission to a Google Sheet in the team's shared Drive folder (backup), then turns it into a branch and pull request. Its source is kept outside this repo. |
| GitHub REST API (no sign-in) | `admin/review.html` | Limited to 60 requests/hour per visitor IP address. See [Known issues](#known-issues-and-gotchas). |
| Quill 1.3.6 | Contribution form | cdn.quilljs.com |
| Leaflet 1.9.4 | 2D map | cdnjs |
| three.js r128 + OrbitControls | 3D map | cdnjs / jsDelivr |
| Google Fonts | Site typography | Libre Caslon Text, Courier Prime |
| UoM Land Parcels (Parkville) | Map overlay | [University of Melbourne open spatial data](https://spatialdata-uom.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/UOM::uom-land-parcels-parkville/about) |

## Known issues and gotchas

- **Field names are inconsistent** (`year` vs `Given Names` vs `Occupation`), and `entityID` mixes numbers and strings (strings are deliberate links made by a person; see the [field reference](#data-directories-and-electoral-rolls)).
- **The A–Z is maintained by hand** as Markdown. See roadmap §3.
- **Review page rate limit (unlikely, but confusing if it happens):** `admin/review.html` calls the GitHub API without signing in, which GitHub caps at 60 requests per hour per IP address. Listing submissions uses one request plus one per open pull request. A small editorial team won't normally reach this, but a large backlog of submissions, or several people on one shared network (e.g. a university or library), could. **Symptoms:** the review page shows an error, an empty list, or submissions that won't load, even though they're visible on GitHub. **Fix:** wait up to an hour, or review directly on GitHub in the meantime.
- **Entries use EAC-CPF loosely.** Every entry is `<entityType>concept</entityType>` (EAC-CPF expects `person`, `corporateBody` or `family`), and most of the schema's structure goes unused. See roadmap §4.
- **No automated checks.** Malformed XML or a broken data file can be merged without anyone noticing. See roadmap §5.

## Roadmap

This is a living plan, so reorder it as priorities and funding change. Items are grouped by theme and roughly ordered within each group, cheapest and most valuable first. **Bold** items are suggested next steps.

### 1. Data structure and loading

Goal: pages only download the data they need, show visitors what's happening while it loads, and the data becomes easier to edit, review and reuse.

- [ ] **Agree on a data schema**: consistent `camelCase` field names (`givenNames`, `surname`, `occupation`, …), a clear rule for `entityID` (numeric record ID plus a separate `personId`/`placeId` for linking across years), and which fields are required. Write it up in `data/SCHEMA.md`.
- [x] **Split the data into JSON files**: one file per source and year in `_data/`, one record per line, with `data/index.json` generated by Jekyll (field names unchanged). Converted by `tools/convert-map-data.js`.
- [x] **Shared data loader** (`scripts/data.js`): each page fetches only the files it needs, in parallel, at most once per page (the browser's cache covers moving between pages). People/Places and search use each year as soon as it arrives; the contribution form fetches only the files holding that entry's records.
- [x] **Loading feedback for visitors**: "Loading the 1905 directory… (4 of 9)", and a message with a *Try again* button if a file fails to load.
- [x] Stop loading the data on every page: only the layouts that use it load it now (#44).
- [x] Convert `UoM_Landuse_2026.js` to `data/uom-land-parcels.geojson`, loaded only by the 2D map.
- [x] Remove `map-data.js` and `UoM_Landuse_2026.js`.
- [x] Renumber the electoral rolls' numeric `entityID`s from 999999, so they no longer clash with the 1930 directory.
- [ ] Draw the maps year by year as the files arrive (they currently wait for every year, because cross-year links and the placing of unmapped records need them all).
- [ ] Cache the data in the browser between visits (IndexedDB), if the normal browser cache turns out not to be enough.

### 2. Better search

- [x] **Build a search index of entries and directory data together**, so one search box finds both "Corkman Hotel" (the entry) and every directory listing for it. Options: [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/) (static, runs at build time, would need a GitHub Action) or [MiniSearch](https://github.com/lucaong/minisearch) / [Lunr](https://lunrjs.com/) indexes built in the browser or ahead of time. Done in #44 with MiniSearch, built in the browser on the new search page. Revisit Pagefind if entries reach the hundreds.
- [x] **Fuzzy matching for historical spellings** (Berkley/Berkeley, Leister/Leicester, Mrs/Mrs.), with a small list of known variants (#44; the list is `VARIANTS` in `scripts/search.js`).
- [x] Search results grouped by type (Entries / People / Places), with snippets and highlighted matches (#44).
- [x] "Trace this person/place across years": linked records show as one result with a row of years, and open to list each year's listing and page (#44).
- [x] Shareable search URLs (`?q=…&year=…&street=…`) (#44).
- [x] Load the search index only when the search page is opened (#44).

### 3. Editorial tools (towards a proper GUI for a non-technical team)

Goal: editors never need to touch GitHub directly. Done in small, fundable steps, with each step useful on its own.

**Markdown pages** (`aToZ.md`, `index.md` and other plain pages)

- [ ] **Editor for Markdown pages**, see the design proposal: [`docs/proposals/markdown-page-editor.md`](docs/proposals/markdown-page-editor.md). Suggested first step: a simple text-and-preview editor for `index.md` and `aToZ.md` that saves through the existing Apps Script, with page edits listed and previewed in `admin/review.html` next to entry submissions. Editors sign in with Google, checked by the Apps Script against an editors list.
- [x] **Admin landing page** (`admin/index.html`) linking to each admin tool: review, page editor, data editor, and the team's Google Sheet (#45). The page editor and Google Sheet links are placeholders until they exist.
- [ ] **Visual editor for Markdown pages**: an admin page that lists the site's editable pages, opens one in a word-processor-style editor (headings, bold/italic, links, bullet lists; no Markdown syntax needed), shows a live preview in the site's own styles, and saves by opening a pull request that goes through the usual review. Front matter (`title`, `layout`) is shown as simple form fields or hidden, so it can't be broken by accident.
  - Candidate editors: [Toast UI Editor](https://ui.toast.com/tui-editor) or [Milkdown](https://milkdown.dev/) (both edit Markdown visually and save clean Markdown), or the off-the-shelf CMS options below.
- [ ] **A–Z editor**: a dedicated tool for `aToZ.md`. Add, remove, rename and re-letter featured pages from a list; it keeps entries alphabetical, builds the `civic?id=…` links, handles "see also" cross-references (e.g. *Carlton Inn, see: Corkman Hotel*), and flags which links already have a published entry and which are still wanted. Longer term, the A–Z could be generated from data (`civic/` plus a "wanted entries" list) rather than edited as text.

**Entries and submissions**

- [x] Clearer review page: three numbered steps and two buttons, links back to Admin and the site, and the preview shows just the article (#50).
- [ ] **Accept/Reject buttons on the review page** (through the existing submission service or GitHub sign-in), with a "reason for rejection" box that is posted as a comment for the record.
- [ ] Edit a submission's text in the review page before accepting it.

**Directory/map data**

- [ ] **Data editor saves by pull request**: replace "download, then upload to GitHub by hand" with a *Submit changes* button that opens a pull request, as the contribution form already does. This removes the riskiest manual step and becomes much easier once the data is split into per-year JSON (§1).
- [ ] **Data-change preview on the review page**: show a readable table of changed records (before → after) instead of a raw diff.
- [x] Data editor uses the same fonts, colours and buttons as the review page, with one main *Download* button (#50).

**Off-the-shelf options to compare against building our own**

- [ ] Evaluate a git-based CMS such as [Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org/) or [Sveltia CMS](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms). These provide Markdown page editing, an editorial approval workflow and media uploads out of the box, and run on GitHub Pages without a server (they may need a small sign-in service). They may cover the Markdown editor and part of the review flow more cheaply than custom tools, but are less suited to the XML entries and the directory data.
- [ ] Later: revisit whether the Google Apps Script is still the best way to receive submissions, depending on which options above are chosen.

### 4. Making full and correct use of EAC-CPF

Goal: entries become proper, interoperable archival authority records that other systems (e.g. Trove, archives, the Encyclopedia of Melbourne) could understand and link to.

- [ ] **Use the right `entityType`**: `person`, `corporateBody` (hotels, breweries, companies, societies) or `family`. Topics like *Cesspits* or *Street Numbering* aren't really EAC-CPF entities, so decide whether they stay as entries with a local type (`localControl` / `localType`, e.g. "Topic", "Street", "Building") or move to a separate format. Using `concept` for everything is the first thing to correct.
- [ ] **Structured names**: `nameEntry` with proper `part localType="surname"` / `"forename"`, plus alternative and historical names (`nameEntryParallel`, `useDates`), e.g. *Carlton Inn* / *Corkman Hotel*. This would also fix the renderer, which currently assumes the first two `part`s are the family name and the given name.
- [ ] **Dates**: `existDates` with `dateRange` and `standardDate` attributes, so entries can be sorted, filtered by period and shown on a timeline.
- [ ] **Places**: `places` / `place` with `placeEntry` and coordinates (`latitude`/`longitude`), linking entries to the map.
- [ ] **Occupations, functions and legal status**: `occupations`, `functions`, `legalStatuses` (e.g. a hotel's licence).
- [ ] **Relationships**: `cpfRelation` between entries (licensee ↔ hotel, person ↔ family) and `resourceRelation` to sources and to directory records, displayed on the page as "Related" links.
- [ ] **Sources and citations**: `sources` / `source` for each entry, shown as a reference list.
- [ ] **Richer narrative**: structured `biogHist` (`abstract`, `chronList` for dated events), and render them on entry pages.
- [ ] **Better maintenance records**: one `maintenanceEvent` per edit (created / revised), with the agent who made it, and use `maintenanceStatus` correctly (`new` → `revised`).
- [ ] Have the submission form and editors produce valid, richer XML. Write a short EAC-CPF style guide (`docs/eac-cpf-guide.md`) with examples for each entity type.
- [ ] Validate entries against the EAC-CPF schema (see §5).

### 5. Quality and safety nets

- [ ] **GitHub Action that runs on every pull request**: check that XML is well-formed and valid EAC-CPF, check that data JSON is valid against the schema, and check that the entry filename matches the `recordId`. Editors would then see a green tick or red cross on each submission.
- [ ] Commit a `Gemfile` so local builds match GitHub Pages.
- [ ] Contributor guide (`CONTRIBUTING.md`) setting out entry conventions as they're agreed.

### 6. Maps and community geocoding

Placing records on the map is **ongoing community work**: about 16% of records have coordinates today, and that number should keep growing as volunteers contribute. The aim here is to make that work easy and inviting, not to finish it.

- [ ] **"Help put this on the map"**: on records without coordinates, a prompt that lets a volunteer drop a pin on the map and submit it for review.
- [ ] Show geocoding progress (e.g. "1,454 of 9,236 records mapped") on the map page as a community goal.
- [ ] Year slider/filter on the 2D map to show the precinct changing from 1900 to 1930.
- [ ] Link map markers to entries and entries to map locations (see §4, Places).
- [ ] Historical base map overlays (e.g. MMBW plans), if suitable public-domain scans are available.
- [x] **Bring the experimental 3D map in line with the 2D map**: same data and features, and refactor so both maps share functions (e.g. data loading, filtering, popups) instead of duplicating code. Done in #46 with `scripts/map-common.js`.

### 7. Look and feel

- [x] **Fix bulleted and numbered lists on content pages**, e.g. the area list on the home page. Done in #37: list styles for unclassed `ul`/`ol` inside `.main-content` in `styles/site.css`.
- [x] **Style Markdown headings and other content**: `h2`–`h4`, rules, tables, blockquotes and inline code on Markdown pages now use the site's serif and tokens (direct children of `.main-content` only, so entry and facet-list layouts keep their own styles).
- [x] **Fix the A–Z page**: the cramped letter-bar table is now an evenly spaced row of letter buttons (a Markdown list with `{: .az-index}`), and the Back to Top links point at `#featured-pages-a-to-z` (#41).
- [x] On the A–Z page, mark which links have a published entry and which are still wanted. Done in #47: "Not yet written" and "New" marks, with a legend.
- [x] **Restyle the contribution form to match the site**: use the site's tokens and fonts, and size the iframe to its content instead of `min-height: 800px` (#48). (The double rule under entry titles was removed in #43.)
- [x] **Give "Suggest new article" a proper page**: `new.md` now has a heading and a short explanation, and the field and button use the site's styles.
- [x] **People / Places contents**: show the year after each street name, e.g. "Bouverie Street (1905) listings". Sort by street within each year. One long page is fine (#51). (The extra `.facet-list` side padding was removed in #43.)
- [ ] **Mobile pass**:
  - [ ] 2D map: collapse the layers panel on phones and use the moss accent colour.
  - [x] 3D map: add a ← Home link and use `100dvh`.
  - [x] Nav: fit all five items on one row on phones.
  - [x] Search on phones: results are cards and filters fold away on the new search page (#44).
- [x] **Accessibility pass**: keyboard navigation for search and maps, colour contrast, focus styles and alt text. (A site-wide focus outline and a darker `--ink-faint` for small labels were added in #43; the rest in #54.)

### 8. Site and content

- [ ] Replace the "under construction" notice with a permanent, welcoming "this is a work in progress, and you can help" message that links to ways to contribute.
- [ ] Add an About page, Acknowledgement of Country, credits and licence to the site.
- [ ] Cite sources consistently on entry pages, with a "how to cite this page" box.
- [ ] Support images in entries.
- [x] Use one name, "Featured pages", for the A–Z page everywhere, including the footer.
- [x] Footer links to People, Places and the Admin page (which replaces the direct data-editor link) (#49).
